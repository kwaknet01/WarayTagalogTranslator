<b> English To German Translator </b>

# overview
--------

This program takes a list of English words and the German equivalent and using machine learning with the Python programming language trains the program to predict the correct translation. The entire process is then given an web interface using nodeJS as the server and Ajax on the front end along with HTML and CSS to call the server and execute the Python Scripts. The results from the training of the system would be displayed in an output field though it takes around 10-20 minutes to train the program, while only around 3-6 minutes to evaluate the results. You can set the number of epochs which would control how many times the program would be trained where the more epochs you set it to the more accurate the result but also the longer the training would be. Lastly you can reverse the word order which would translate from German to English.
